- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer "bug" was actually a real bug? In 1947, when engineers were working on the Harvard Mark II computer, they discovered a moth causing a malfunction.
               They taped it into their logbook with the caption "First actual case of bug being found". And thus, the term "computer bug" was born! 🐛✨
